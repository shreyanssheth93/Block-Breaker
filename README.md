# Block-Breaker
A simple Block breaker game and fun to play.

A recreation of classic block breaking games like Arkanoid. There will be background music, and sound effects for the ball bouncing, and for the blocks breaking. Once all destructible blocks on the level are gone, you move onto the next level without interruption of the music
